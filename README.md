# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch** repository! This project is aimed at implementing various machine learning algorithms from the ground up, without relying on high-level libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mathematics, logic, and mechanics of these algorithms.

<!-- ## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Basic Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/machine-learning-from-scratch.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd machine-learning-from-scratch
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented in its own Python file, located in the `algorithms/` directory. You can run the algorithms individually or use them as part of your own projects.

### Example: Running Linear Regression
1. Navigate to the `algorithms/linear_regression/` directory.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python linear_regression.py
   ```
3. The script will train the model on a sample dataset and display the results.

### Example: Running K-Means Clustering
1. Navigate to the `algorithms/k_means/` directory.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python k_means.py
   ```
3. The script will cluster the data and visualize the results using Matplotlib.
