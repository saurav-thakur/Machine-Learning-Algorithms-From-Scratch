The process of finding minima (or maxima) involves analyzing the behavior of a function, and the approach differs depending on whether you are using a **closed-form solution** or an **optimization technique**. Here's why:

---

### **1. Closed-Form Solution: Setting First Derivative to Zero**

In a closed-form solution, you are solving for the minimum (or maximum) of a function analytically. The key idea is based on calculus:

- **First Derivative Test**: The first derivative of a function, \( f'(x) \), represents the slope of the function at any point \( x \). At a minimum or maximum, the slope is **zero** (i.e., the function is "flat" at that point). Therefore, setting \( f'(x) = 0 \) and solving for \( x \) helps identify **critical points** (candidates for minima or maxima).

- **Second Derivative Test**: To confirm whether a critical point is a minimum, you can check the second derivative, \( f''(x) \). If \( f''(x) > 0 \), the point is a local minimum.

This approach works well for simple, differentiable functions where you can explicitly solve \( f'(x) = 0 \).

### **2. Optimization Techniques: Iterative Search Using the First Derivative**

In optimization problems (especially in machine learning or complex real-world applications), the function may be:

- High-dimensional (many variables),
- Non-differentiable,
- Too complex to solve analytically.

In such cases, you use **iterative optimization techniques** (e.g., gradient descent, Newton's method) to find the minimum. Here's how it works:

- **First Derivative as a Guide**: The first derivative (gradient) provides information about the direction of the steepest ascent. To find a minimum, you move in the **opposite direction** of the gradient (steepest descent).

- **Iterative Updates**: Instead of solving \( f'(x) = 0 \) directly, you start at an initial guess and iteratively update the solution using the gradient:
  \[
  x*{new} = x*{old} - \alpha \cdot f'(x\_{old})
  \]
  Here, \( \alpha \) is the learning rate (step size). You repeat this process until the gradient is close to zero (indicating convergence to a minimum).

- **Why Not Set \( f'(x) = 0 \) Directly?** In complex problems, solving \( f'(x) = 0 \) analytically may be impossible or computationally expensive. Optimization techniques provide a practical way to approximate the solution.

### **Key Differences**

| **Aspect**             | **Closed-Form Solution**                   | **Optimization Technique**                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Goal**               | Find exact solution analytically.          | Approximate solution iteratively.                   |
| **Derivative Use**     | Set \( f'(x) = 0 \) and solve for \( x \). | Use \( f'(x) \) to guide updates.                   |
| **Applicability**      | Simple, differentiable functions.          | Complex, high-dimensional, or non-smooth functions. |
| **Computational Cost** | Low (if solvable).                         | Can be high (depends on iterations).                |
| **Examples**           | Solving \( f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 4 \).         | Training neural networks, logistic regression.      |

### **Summary**

- In **closed-form solutions**, you set the first derivative to zero because it directly identifies critical points (minima or maxima) for simple, differentiable functions.
- In **optimization techniques**, you use the first derivative iteratively to guide the search for minima, especially when analytical solutions are infeasible or the function is too complex.

Both approaches rely on the first derivative but are applied differently depending on the problem's complexity and structure.
